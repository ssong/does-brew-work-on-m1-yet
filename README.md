# Does brew work on M1 yet?

I wanted to jump on the M1 train, but Homebrew wasn't available yet.

So just to pass time made a small tracker that keeps an eye on the issue state for adding macOS 11 and Apple Silicon compatibility into Homebrew.

## Uses

* GitHub REST API v3
* Next.js default styling for the most part
* Axios and `axios-rate-limit` for rate limiting on the API
* Deployed on Vercel
